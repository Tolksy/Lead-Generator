# Graphic Design Studio

## How It Works

1. **You get a prompt from Gemini** describing your design
2. **You give me (Claude) the prompt** in our chat
3. **I create a new HTML file** with the design in code
4. **The design shows up** on your library page
5. **Click to view/export** the design for VistaPrint

## Setup

Just open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.

## Adding New Designs

When you give me a prompt, I'll:
1. Create a new HTML file in the `designs/` folder
2. Update the list in `index.html`

Each design is self-contained code that draws on a canvas.

## Example Prompt

"Create a business card for my plumbing company 'Quick Fix Plumbing'. Dark blue background, white text. Include phone (555) 987-6543, email joe@quickfix.com, and tagline 'Fast, Reliable Service'"

I'll generate the code and add it to your library.
